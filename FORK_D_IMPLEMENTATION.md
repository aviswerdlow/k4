# Fork D - K4 External Constraints Investigation

## Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive K4 external constraints investigation system according to your specifications. Here's what has been built:

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. **Berlin Clock System** (HIGHEST PRIORITY - COMPLETE)
**Location:** `07_TOOLS/berlin_clock/`

- `berlin_clock_simulator.py`: Deterministic Berlin Clock simulator with time-to-state conversion
- `berlin_clock_k4.py`: Full K4 application with L=17 wheel families
- 4 keystream mapping methods implemented:
  - `on_off_count_per_row`: Row lamp counts to keystream
  - `base5_vector`: Base-5 interpretation with hash
  - `pattern_signature`: FNV-1a hash of patterns  
  - `row3_triplet_marks`: Quarter-hour markers sparse keystream
- Fixed timestamp tests including:
  - 1990-11-03 14:00 (Kryptos dedication)
  - 1989-11-09 18:53 (Berlin Wall)
  - All hours on the hour (00:00-23:00)
  - Sweep tests for comprehensive coverage
- Full result card generation with strict schema compliance
- `METHODS_MANIFEST.json` with frozen constants

### 2. **Tableau Synchronizer** (HIGH PRIORITY - COMPLETE)
**Location:** `07_TOOLS/tableau_sync/`

- `tableau_synchronizer.py`: Front/back tableau mapping system
- Builds full 27-row Kryptos keyed tableau (including anomalous L row)
- Tests implemented:
  - Straight lines (horizontal/vertical through anchors)
  - Diagonals (NW-SE, NE-SW patterns)
  - Spirals (from central points)
- Generates `k4_tableau_sync.csv` with complete position mapping
- Result cards for all alignment tests

### 3. **Physical Position Analysis** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETE)
**Location:** `04_EXPERIMENTS/physical_analysis/`

- `physical_position.py`: Comprehensive physical pattern analysis
- Tests implemented:
  - Modular intervals (mod 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,17)
  - Distance from nearest anchor analysis
  - Physical clustering in various layouts (7x14, 8x12, 10x10)
  - Morse alignment conceptual framework
- Generates visualization PDF with distribution plots
- `PHYS_CLUSTER.json` with all pattern data

### 4. **Declination-Corrected Bearings** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETE)
**Location:** `07_TOOLS/bearings/`

- `bearing_analysis.py`: Compass bearing analysis with magnetic declination
- Langley, VA 1990 declination: 10.5° West (fixed constant)
- Full bearing table with magnetic→true conversions
- Keystream generation methods (modular, scaled, hash)
- Position selector tests using bearing degrees
- Angular distance calculations between bearings
- `bearing_reference.json` with all conversions

### 5. **Build System** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Project root

- `Makefile`: Comprehensive build system with targets:
  - `make all`: Run all tests
  - `make berlin-clock-all`: Berlin Clock tests only
  - `make tableau-sync`: Tableau synchronization only
  - `make physical-analysis`: Physical analysis only
  - `make bearings`: Bearings analysis only
  - `make validate`: Validate all result cards
  - `make clean`: Clean all generated files

### 6. **CI/CD Validation** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** `.github/workflows/`

- `validate-fork-d.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow
- Validates MASTER_SEED = 1337 in all files
- Tests all simulators and analyzers
- Validates result card schema compliance
- Checks anchor preservation logic
- Fails if claims don't match evidence

### 7. **Validation Tools** (COMPLETE)
**Location:** Project root

- `validate_result_cards.py`: Comprehensive result card validator
- Strict schema enforcement
- Logic validation (reduction claims must list positions)
- Batch validation of entire directories

## 📊 Result Card Schema (Strict Compliance)

Every test generates a result card with this exact schema:

```json
{
  "mechanism": "BerlinClock@1990-11-03T14:00:00Z/base5_row_counts",
  "unknowns_before": 50,
  "unknowns_after": 50,
  "anchors_preserved": true,
  "new_positions_determined": [],
  "indices_before": [/* 50 unknown indices */],
  "indices_after": [/* remaining unknowns */],
  "parameters": { /* exact test parameters */ },
  "seed": 1337,
  "notes": "Description of test"
}
```

## 🔧 Key Design Decisions

1. **MASTER_SEED = 1337**: Frozen across all components for determinism
2. **No Semantics**: Pure mechanical tests, no language gates or frequency analysis
3. **Anchor Preservation**: EAST (21-24), NORTHEAST (25-33), BERLIN (63-68), CLOCK (69-73) must remain intact
4. **L=17 Only**: No period adaptation for this fork
5. **Clean Negatives**: Negative results are valuable and properly documented
6. **Frozen Constants**: All mapping constants are documented and immutable

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
make all

# Run specific mechanism
make berlin-clock-all
make tableau-sync
make physical-analysis
make bearings

# Validate results
make validate

# Clean everything
make clean
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Breakthrough**: Any test reducing 50 → <50 unknowns while preserving anchors
- **Progress**: Reproducible correlations even without full determination
- **Negative Value**: Clean "no effect" documentation to prevent re-testing

## 🔍 What to Look For

When running tests, watch for:
- Any result card with `unknowns_after < unknowns_before`
- Files named `HITS.json` containing successful reductions
- `RUN_SUMMARY.csv` files for quick overview
- Validation passing with no schema errors

## 📝 Notes

- The Berlin Clock is the highest priority as it's the only external object explicitly mentioned by Sanborn
- All tests are deterministic and reproducible
- Composite mechanisms (Task 5) can be added to combine successful single mechanisms
- The system is designed for transparency and audit-readiness

## Status: READY FOR EXECUTION

All core components are implemented and tested. The system is ready to search for external constraints that might reduce the 50 unknown positions in K4.

Start with: `make berlin-clock-all`

This is Sanborn's explicit hint - if there's an external key, the Berlin Clock is the most likely candidate.
