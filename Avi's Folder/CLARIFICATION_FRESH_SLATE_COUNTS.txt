CLARIFICATION ON FRESH-SLATE DERIVATION COUNTS
==============================================

The fresh-slate K4 derivation with L=17 and four anchors produces:
- 24 derived positions 
- 73 unknown positions

This is CORRECT and here's why:

1. PERIOD AND SLOT MECHANICS
   - All 6 classes use period L=17
   - With 97 total positions, each class has ~16-17 indices
   - Since 97/6 â‰ˆ 16.2 < 17, each slot appears AT MOST ONCE per class
   - No slot reuse means no additional propagation

2. ANCHOR FORCING
   - EAST (21-24): Forces 4 slots across classes
   - NORTHEAST (25-33): Forces 9 slots across classes  
   - BERLIN (63-68): Forces 6 slots across classes
   - CLOCK (69-73): Forces 5 slots across classes
   - Total: 24 unique slots forced across all wheels

3. DERIVATION COUNT
   - Each forced slot determines exactly 1 position (no reuse with L=17)
   - 24 forced slots = 24 derived positions
   - 97 - 24 = 73 unknown positions

4. WHY NOT 71 DERIVED?
   The "71 derived" figure would require either:
   - A smaller period (e.g., L=11) causing slot reuse, OR
   - Additional information beyond the 4 anchors (like the tail)
   
   With L=17 (as in the actual solution), 4 anchors alone give 24 derived.

5. WHAT THIS PROVES
   - The derivation is purely algebraic - no guessing
   - Only positions with forced wheel slots can be derived
   - The remaining 73 positions need additional information (the tail)
   - This demonstrates the cryptographic necessity of the tail

The fresh-slate runs correctly show:
- RUN_A (no cribs): 0 derived, 97 unknown
- RUN_B (EAST only): 4 derived, 93 unknown  
- RUN_C (EAST+NORTHEAST): 13 derived, 84 unknown
- RUN_D (four anchors): 24 derived, 73 unknown

These numbers are mathematically correct for L=17 with the given cribs.
