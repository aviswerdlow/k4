NSA-STYLE STRUCTURE TESTS - CORE HARDENING V4
==============================================

COMPLETED: All deliverables ready for forum posting

A) K3 NSA METHOD DEMONSTRATION
------------------------------
✓ K3 transposition demo showing fixed pattern from typographic cues
✓ Co-prime coverage explainer (gcd(4,7)=1 → full coverage)
✓ Visual PDFs demonstrating the precedent
Files: K3_METHOD_DEMO.pdf, K3_COPRIME_EXPLAIN.pdf

B) K4 CO-PRIME DIAGNOSTICS
--------------------------
✓ Co-prime analyzer confirming L=17 → each slot appears ≤1 time
✓ With baseline classing + L=17: 4 anchors force 24 slots → 24 derived
✓ SLOT_USAGE_CHART.pdf shows visually that no slot repeats
✓ DERIVABLE_FROM_ANCHORS.csv predicts exactly 24 derived

C) ANCHOR ARITHMETIC LEDGER
---------------------------
✓ Complete arithmetic for all 24 anchor positions
✓ Shows C, P, K values and mod-26 calculations
✓ Verifiable with pencil and paper
File: K4_ANCHOR_LEDGER.pdf

D) WHEEL CARDS
--------------
✓ Before (anchors-only): Shows 24 forced slots, rest unknown
✓ After (full solution): Shows all slots filled
✓ Visual explanation of "why 24" and "why 97"
Files: K4_WHEEL_CARDS.pdf, K4_WHEEL_SUMMARY.pdf

E) FRESH-SLATE VERIFICATION
---------------------------
✓ RUN_D: 24 derived, 73 unknown (matches co-prime analysis)
✓ No hypothesis scaffolding, no AI, stdlib only
✓ Pure algebraic derivation from CT + cribs

F) DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
------------------------
✓ README.md includes NSA cue bridge section
✓ Links co-prime property from K3 to K4
✓ Explains why L=17 → 24 derived with 4 anchors

G) DELIVERABLES
---------------
In Avi's Folder:
• K3_Hints_Demo.zip - K3 precedent materials
• K4_Coprime_Demo.zip - Complete co-prime analysis
• K4_Hand_Cards.zip - Hand verification materials

KEY INSIGHT
-----------
The co-prime property (L=17 with 97 positions) ensures:
- Each slot appears at most once per class
- Forced slots = derived positions (no multiplication)
- 4 anchors → 24 slots → 24 derived → 73 unknown

This is mathematically rigorous and paper-verifiable.
No AI, no hypothesis layers, pure stdlib Python.
