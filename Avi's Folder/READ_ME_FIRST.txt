K3 HINTS AND FRESH-SLATE K4 DERIVATION
=======================================

This package demonstrates:
1. K0→K1/K2 keyword extraction using the forum's dots/E's method
2. K3→K4 structural parameter extraction (no prose, just math)
3. Fresh-slate K4 derivation from CT + params + minimal cribs

RUN_A.pdf - No cribs (0 derived, 97 unknown)
RUN_B.pdf - EAST only (4 derived, 93 unknown)
RUN_C.pdf - EAST+NORTHEAST (13 derived, 84 unknown)
RUN_D.pdf - Four anchors (24 derived, 73 unknown)

KEY FORMULA
-----------
class(i) = ((i % 2) * 3) + (i % 3)

This creates 6 interleaved tracks (classes 0-5).

PARAMETERS CHOSEN
-----------------
- Periods: L=17 for all classes (smallest that seats anchors without collision)
- Families: V V B V B V (first family satisfying Option-A per class)
- Phase: 0 for all classes

WHAT THIS SHOWS
---------------
The fresh-slate derivations show only what is algebraically forced:
- Letters where the wheel slots are determined by cribs
- Question marks (?) where slots remain unknown
- No tail letters planted anywhere
- Pure mechanical derivation, no AI, no hypothesis scaffolding

This addresses the forum's request for "solve from the copper" by showing
exactly what can be derived at each crib level using 1989-style hand methods.
