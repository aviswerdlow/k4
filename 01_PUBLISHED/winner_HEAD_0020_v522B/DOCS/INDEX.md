# K4 By-Hand Walkthrough - Visual Materials Index

## Quick Start
**Main PDF**: [K4_By_Hand_Walkthrough.pdf](K4_By_Hand_Walkthrough.pdf) - Full color version for screen viewing  
**Print Version**: [K4_By_Hand_Walkthrough_grayscale.pdf](K4_By_Hand_Walkthrough_grayscale.pdf) - High-contrast grayscale for printing

## Individual Figures

### Page 1: The Map
**[FIG_class_grid.png](FIG_class_grid.png)**
- 6-row class grid showing all indices 0-96
- Highlighted cribs: EAST (21-24), NORTHEAST (25-33), BERLIN (63-68), CLOCK (69-73)
- Highlighted tail region (75-96)
- Complete legend with decrypt formulas and A=0..Z=25 reference

### Page 2: Forcing K at Anchors
**[FIG_anchor_forcing.png](FIG_anchor_forcing.png)**
- Four worked examples from each crib
- Shows complete calculation: index → class → family → K derivation
- Mini wheel diagrams showing forced slots
- Option-A verification (K ≠ 0 check)

### Page 3: Tail Propagation
**[FIG_tail_propagation.png](FIG_tail_propagation.png)**
- Detailed walkthrough of indices 80-84
- Visual conversion: TJCDI → OFANA
- Complete calculation table with all intermediate steps
- Shows "JOY OF AN ANGLE" emergence

### Page 4: Verification
**[FIG_roundtrip_dropcrib.png](FIG_roundtrip_dropcrib.png)**
- Round-trip encryption examples proving reversibility
- Drop-crib illustration showing BERLIN removal effect
- Demonstrates that removed cribs remain undetermined (not reconstructed)

## Usage Guide

### For Forum Members
1. Start with the main PDF for complete walkthrough
2. Print grayscale version for pencil-and-paper work
3. Use individual figures as reference cards

### For Verification
- Follow Page 1 to understand the class system
- Use Page 2 to see how cribs force specific K values
- Page 3 shows complete hand calculation example
- Page 4 proves the system's mathematical consistency

## Technical Details
