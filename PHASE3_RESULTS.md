# Phase 3 Execution Results

## Summary
All priority manifests (A1-A3, B1-B2, C1) have been executed successfully.

## Key Findings

### Round-Trip Validation
✅ **All manifests achieve perfect round-trip**: They can encrypt back to the original ciphertext deterministically.

### BERLINCLOCK Detection
❌ **No manifest produces BERLINCLOCK at positions 64-73**
- A1: Got "YPVTTMZFPK" at control positions
- A2-C1: Similar non-matching results

This is expected behavior - we're testing hypothetical solutions and haven't found the correct K4 key/operation combination yet.

### What This Means

1. **Framework is working correctly**: The system can test manifests, validate round-trips, and check for BERLINCLOCK.

2. **No solution found yet**: None of the initial 6 priority manifests (A1-A3, B1-B2, C1) produced readable plaintext with BERLINCLOCK.

3. **Ready for escalation**: The framework is ready to:
   - Test additional key combinations
   - Try different mask patterns from discovery
   - Apply twists to promising candidates
   - Test with Antipodes reordering

## Next Steps

Per the runbook escalation path:

### Escalation A: Mask Discovery
```bash
python3 04_EXPERIMENTS/mask_discovery/discover_masks.py --ct 02_DATA/ciphertext_97.txt --out 04_EXPERIMENTS/mask_discovery/reports
```
Results show periodicity analysis suggests trying period-5 and period-7 masks.

### Escalation B: Alternative Keys
Try these key combinations:
- LATITUDE, LONGITUDE
- TANGENT, SECANT
- SHADOW, LIGHT, LODESTONE, GIRASOL

### Escalation C: Control Mode
Switch to control mode where positions 64-73 act as control signals.

### Escalation D: Additional Routes
Test untested routes like alt_rows and spiral with existing keys.

## Technical Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Zone-based decryption framework
- ✅ Mask library (8 types implemented)
- ✅ Route engine (5 types implemented)
- ✅ Cipher families (Vigenere & Beaufort)
- ✅ Round-trip validation
- ✅ Null control testing
- ✅ K5 gate checking
- ✅ Antipodes reordering

### What Needs Investigation
- Finding the correct key(s)
- Finding the correct mask/route combination
- Potentially a missing operation or twist

## Recommendation

Since no initial manifest produced BERLINCLOCK, we should:

1. **Expand the key search space** with the alternative keys listed above
2. **Try discovered masks** from the periodicity analysis
3. **Test control mode** where BERLINCLOCK positions drive key rotation
4. **Apply systematic twists** to the most promising candidates

The framework is functioning correctly and ready for expanded search.
