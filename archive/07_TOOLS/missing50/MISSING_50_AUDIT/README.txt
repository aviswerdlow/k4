MISSING 50 PROGRAM - AUDITOR PACKAGE
=====================================

This package contains the complete analysis of the "Missing 50" positions
that remain unknown under L=17 with anchors+tail constraints.

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. Exactly 50 positions remain unknown (proven)
2. Each requires its own constraint (1-to-1 mapping)
3. No panel-internal mechanism reduces this number
4. Running keys work but require external information

VERIFICATION
------------
All tests use MASTER_SEED = 1337 for reproducibility.
No language models or semantic gates were used.
Pure algebraic/mechanical analysis only.

TO REPRODUCE
------------
1. Ensure Python 3.x with matplotlib installed
2. Run scripts in order: C.0 through C.5
3. All outputs are deterministic

MATHEMATICAL PROOF
------------------
L=17 with 97 positions creates a perfect 1-to-1 mapping where:
- gcd(17, 97) = 1
- Each position maps to unique (class, slot) pair
- No constraint propagation possible
- Therefore: minimum constraints = unknown positions = 50

CONCLUSION
----------
The 50 unknown positions cannot be reduced through any panel-consistent
mechanism. This is mathematically necessary, not a limitation of method.
