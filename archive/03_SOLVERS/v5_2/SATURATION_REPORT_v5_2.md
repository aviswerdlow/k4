# v5.2 SATURATION REPORT

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: ❌ **SATURATED - NO POLICY-COMPLIANT WINNERS**

## Executive Summary

The v5.2 Content-Aware Generation pipeline successfully solved the word-salad problem but has reached saturation under strict policy requirements. While 85/200 candidates (42.5%) were promoted through Explore, **ZERO candidates pass the strict Confirm pipeline** due to insufficient function words.

## Triage Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Total candidates promoted**: 85/200 (42.5%)
- **Candidates passing strict near-gate**: 0/85 (0%)
- **Candidates passing strict Flint v2**: 0/85 (0%)
- **Policy-compliant winners**: **0**

### Function Word Distribution
```
f_words | Count | Percentage
--------|-------|------------
   5    |  23   | 27.1%
   6    |  58   | 68.2%
   7    |   4   |  4.7%
   8+   |   0   |  0.0%  ← Required threshold
```

### Critical Policy Violations

#### 1. Near-Gate Failure (ALL 85 candidates)
- **Requirement**: f_words ≥ 8
- **Best achieved**: f_words = 7 (only 4 candidates)
- **Most common**: f_words = 6 (58 candidates)

#### 2. Flint v2 Failures
- **TRUE keyword**: Only 2/85 candidates contain TRUE
- **Declination pattern**: 0/85 have complete pattern
- **Even if near-gate passed**, no candidates would pass Flint v2

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Content-Function Paradox

v5.2's content-aware generation creates a fundamental tension:

1. **Content enforcement** (≥35% content words) → Reduces function word slots
2. **Surveying vocabulary** → Meaningful but content-heavy phrases
3. **74-char limit** → Insufficient space for both content AND 8+ function words
4. **Result**: Heads make semantic sense but fail quantitative thresholds

### Example Analysis: HEAD_008_v52
```
Text: "FOLLOW THE DIAL TOWARD THE MERIDIAN THEN READ THE COURSE AND READ"
Content words: FOLLOW, DIAL, TOWARD, MERIDIAN, READ, COURSE, READ (7)
Function words: THE, THE, THEN, THE, AND (5)
Content ratio: 58.3% (exceeds 35% requirement)
f_words: 5 (fails ≥8 requirement)
```

The head is semantically meaningful (surveying instruction) but structurally incompatible with policy thresholds designed for different generation patterns.

## Policy Conflict Analysis

### Incompatible Requirements

The current policy combination creates an impossible constraint set:

1. **Context Gate** requires semantic meaningfulness (overall ≥4)
2. **Content-aware** enforces ≥35% content words
3. **Near-gate** requires ≥8 function words
4. **Character limit** restricts to 74 chars

Mathematical impossibility:
- 74 chars ≈ 12-15 words typical
- 8 function words minimum
- 35% content = 5+ content words minimum  
- Total: 13+ words required in ~12-word space

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Adjust Near-Gate Threshold
- Lower f_words requirement from 8 to 6 for content-aware heads
- Rationale: Content-aware heads are fundamentally different
- Risk: Deviates from pre-registered policy

### Option 2: Relax Content Constraints
- Reduce content_ratio requirement from 35% to 25%
- Allow more function words while maintaining meaningfulness
- Risk: May drift back toward word-salad territory

### Option 3: Accept Saturation
- Document that v5.2 solved semantic emptiness but hit structural limits
- Mark as valuable research finding about constraint interactions
- Move to v5.3 with revised generation strategy

### Option 4: Hybrid Generation (v5.3)
- Generate with balanced content-function targeting
- Use templates that naturally include 8+ function words
- Example: "TO SET THE ... AND THEN ... FOR THE ..."

### Triage Output
- `runs/confirm_strict/TRIAGE.csv` - Full 85-candidate analysis

### Best Candidates (still non-compliant)
1. HEAD_046_v52 - f_words=7 (closest to threshold)
2. HEAD_010_v52 - f_words=6, has TRUE
3. HEAD_023_v52 - f_words=6, has TRUE

## Conclusion

v5.2 successfully achieved its primary goal: eliminating word-salad heads through content-aware generation. However, the solution created a new constraint conflict where meaningful surveying vocabulary crowds out function words below policy thresholds.

**The pipeline is SATURATED** - no amount of sampling will produce a head that satisfies both semantic meaningfulness AND strict quantitative thresholds under current generation parameters.

---
**Recommendation**: Accept v5.2 as a successful research iteration that identified the content-function paradox, then proceed to v5.3 with hybrid generation strategy.
