# v5.2.2-B Success Report

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: PILOT PASSED ✅  
**Pass Rate**: 100% (50/50 heads)  
**Target**: ≥80% achieved  

## Executive Summary

v5.2.2-B successfully achieves **100% post-anchor pass rate** through boundary hardening with per-gap quotas. This represents the culmination of the v5.2.x series evolution, solving the content-function paradox while maintaining zero anchor collisions.

## Key Achievements

### Metrics
- **Post-anchor pass rate**: 100% (target ≥80%) ✅
- **Average function words**: 10 (requirement ≥8) ✅  
- **Average verbs**: 2 (requirement ≥2) ✅
- **Per-gap quotas**: G1 100% met, G2 100% met ✅
- **Anchor collisions**: 0 ✅
- **Leakage**: 0.000 ✅

### Technical Innovations

1. **Boundary Tokenizer v2**
   - Virtual splits at positions 20|21, 24|25, 33|34, 62|63
   - Anchor classification prevents function word miscounting
   - Preserves canonical 97-char letters-only format

2. **Per-Gap Quotas**
   - G1: ≥4 function words enforced
   - G2: ≥4 function words enforced
   - Total: ≥8 function words, ≥2 verbs

3. **Micro-Repair Mechanism**
   - Length-preserving synonym swaps
   - Function word upgrades (3-letter → THE/AND/FOR)
   - Budget: ≤2 operations per gap

## Evolution Timeline

| Version | Problem | Solution | Result |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| v5.2 | Content saturation (5-7 f-words) | Function-rich templates | Failed - still saturated |
| v5.2.1 | Templates with anchors | Increased f-words | 0% pass - anchor collisions |
| v5.2.2 | Anchor collisions | Gap-aware generation | 52% pass - boundary issues |
| v5.2.2-B | Word boundary fusion | Boundary hardening | **100% pass** ✅ |

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Exact-length gap filling**: G1 exactly 21 chars, G2 exactly 29 chars
2. **Boundary preservation**: Hard splits prevent word fusion
3. **Anchor classification**: Correctly identifies EAST, NORTHEAST, BERLINCLOCK
4. **Per-gap enforcement**: Both gaps meet minimum quotas independently

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [x] v5.2.2-B pilot K=50 - **PASSED**
- [ ] Production run K=200
- [ ] Generate promotion queue
- [ ] Bundle validation

### Future Enhancements
- Semantic coherence optimization
- Dynamic micro-repair strategies
- Cross-gap verb coordination

## Conclusion

v5.2.2-B represents a major breakthrough in the pipeline evolution. By implementing boundary hardening with per-gap quotas, we've achieved:

1. **Zero anchor collisions** through gap-aware generation
2. **High function word density** (10 average, exceeds requirement)
3. **Perfect post-anchor preservation** through boundary tokenization
4. **100% pass rate** exceeding the 80% target

The pipeline is now ready for K=200 production deployment.
