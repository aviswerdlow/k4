# Fork S - Surveying Cipher Parameters Report

Generated: 2025-09-11 00:49:54

## Summary

- Total tests: 120
- Anchors preserved: 0
- Test batteries: 6
- Cipher families: 10+
- Master seed: 1337

## NO MATCHES

No surveying-parameterized cipher configuration preserved the anchors.

This suggests that:
1. The cipher is not parameterized by these surveying quantities
2. A different transformation or combination is needed
3. The anchors require a different cipher family entirely
