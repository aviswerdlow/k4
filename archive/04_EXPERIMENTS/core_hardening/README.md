# Core-Hardening Program

## Overview

The Core-Hardening Program consists of three comprehensive studies designed to validate the robustness and uniqueness of the K4 algebraic solution. These studies provide auditor-friendly evidence that the solution is tightly constrained and cannot be easily perturbed.

## Three Studies

### Study A: Skeleton Uniqueness Survey
**Purpose**: Test whether alternative periodic classing schemes can re-derive the same 97-letter plaintext from ciphertext under the same four plaintext anchors.

**Key Question**: Is the baseline skeleton `((i%2)*3)+(i%3)` unique, or can other patterns produce valid solutions?

**Directory**: `skeleton_survey/`

### Study B: Tail Necessity
**Purpose**: Test whether any single-letter change in the tail (indices 75-96) can produce a complete, algebraically consistent plaintext.

**Key Question**: Is the tail algebraically locked by the wheel system, or can individual letters be changed?

**Directory**: `tail_necessity/`

### Study C: Anchor Perturbations
**Purpose**: Test the sensitivity of the four plaintext anchors by shifting their indices ±1 and testing split vs combined BERLIN/CLOCK modes.

**Key Question**: How "tight" are the anchor positions? Can they be shifted without breaking the solution?

**Directory**: `anchor_perturbations/`

## Quick Start

### Running All Studies
```bash
make core-harden
```

### Running Individual Studies
```bash
make core-harden-skeletons   # Run skeleton survey
make core-harden-tail        # Run tail necessity
make core-harden-anchors     # Run anchor perturbations
```

### Validating Results
```bash
make core-harden-validate    # Validate all study outputs
```

## Technical Configuration

### Common Parameters
- **Ciphertext**: `02_DATA/ciphertext_97.txt` (canonical, SHA-verified)
- **Baseline Anchors**: 
  - EAST: indices 21-24
  - NORTHEAST: indices 25-33
  - BERLIN: indices 63-68
  - CLOCK: indices 69-73
- **Families**: vigenere, variant_beaufort, beaufort
- **Periods**: L ∈ [10..22]
- **Phases**: 0..L-1
- **Option-A**: K≠0 at anchors for additive families
- **Master Seed**: 1337 (for deterministic execution)

### Skeleton Types Tested (Study A)
1. **Baseline**: `((i%2)*3)+(i%3)` → T=6
2. **Mod-T**: Simple modulo operations `i % T` for T ∈ {2..8}
3. **2D Interleaves**: Patterns like `(i%p) + p*(i%q)`
4. **Affine Mixes**: Patterns like `((i%p)*k + (i%q)) % M`

## Output Files

Each study produces:
- `RESULTS.csv`: Complete test results with all scenarios
- `PROOFS/`: JSON proof files for feasible solutions
- `README.md`: Study-specific analysis and findings
- `RUN_LOG.md`: Execution details and environment info
- `SUMMARY.json`: Machine-readable summary
- `MANIFEST.sha256`: File integrity checksums

## Expected Results

### Study A (Skeleton Survey)
- **Expected**: Only the baseline skeleton produces a valid solution
- **Significance**: Demonstrates uniqueness of the classing scheme

### Study B (Tail Necessity)
- **Expected**: 0 feasible mutations out of 550 tested
- **Significance**: Shows the tail is algebraically locked

### Study C (Anchor Perturbations)
- **Expected**: Only exact baseline positions work
- **Significance**: Demonstrates anchors are tightly constrained

## CI/CD Integration

The studies are automatically validated via GitHub Actions:
- CSV schema validation
- Proof file presence checks
- Manifest integrity verification
- Summary completeness

See `.github/workflows/validate-core-hardening.yml` for details.

## Interpreting Results

### Feasibility Criteria
A solution is considered "feasible" if:
1. All six wheel classes can be solved
2. Option-A is satisfied (no K=0 at anchors for additive families)
3. Full plaintext can be re-derived from ciphertext
4. No undefined positions remain in the derivation

### CSV Column Definitions

**Common Columns**:
- `feasible`: Whether a complete solution was found
- `optionA_ok`: Whether Option-A constraints were satisfied
- `wheels_solved`: Whether all wheel classes were successfully configured
- `pt_sha256`: SHA-256 hash of derived plaintext
- `matches_winner_pt`: Whether derived PT matches the winner plaintext
- `seed_u64`: Deterministic seed for reproducibility
- `runtime_ms`: Execution time in milliseconds

**Study-Specific Columns**:
- Study A: `skeleton_id`, `mapping_spec`, `T`, `present_slots_pct`
- Study B: `index`, `orig_letter`, `mutant_letter`, `failure_reason`
- Study C: `scenario_id`, `[anchor]_start`, `berlin_clock_mode`

## Security Considerations

These studies:
- Use pure algebraic wheel solving (no seam/tail guards)
- Enforce Option-A strictly at all anchor positions
- Verify derivations against canonical ciphertext
- Maintain full reproducibility via deterministic seeding

## What This Tells Us

The Core-Hardening Program provides strong evidence that:

1. **The classing scheme is unique**: Alternative skeletons fail to produce valid solutions
2. **The tail is necessary**: No single letter in the tail can be changed
3. **The anchors are exact**: Shifting anchor positions breaks the solution

Together, these studies demonstrate that the K4 solution is:
- Algebraically tight
- Highly constrained
- Resistant to perturbation
- Unique within the tested parameter space

This materially strengthens the claim that the published solution represents the true, intended plaintext for K4.
