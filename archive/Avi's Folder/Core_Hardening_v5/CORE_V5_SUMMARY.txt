CORE-HARDENING V5 SUMMARY
=========================

Mathematical Facts (No Language Required):
------------------------------------------
• With L=17: Anchors determine 24/97 positions
• Minimal additional constraints needed: 73
• Tail (23 positions) covers: 23/73 slots
• Shortfall: 50 positions beyond tail required

Alternative Mechanisms:
-----------------------
• L=15: Only 21 unknowns (tail sufficient)
• L=20: 49 unknowns (26 beyond tail needed)
• L=17: 73 unknowns (current hypothesis)

Key Insight:
------------
The 1-to-1 mapping under L=17 means no algebraic
manipulation can reduce the 73 unknown positions.
This is a hard mathematical constraint, not a
limitation of our analysis methods.
