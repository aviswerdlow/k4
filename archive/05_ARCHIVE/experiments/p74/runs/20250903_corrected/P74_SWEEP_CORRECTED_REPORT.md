# THE JOY Resolution Program - P74 Sweep Analysis (CORRECTED)

**Experiment Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Status**: **CORRECTED** - Previous analysis contained critical lawfulness checker bugs
**Objective**: Determine if P[74]='T' is effectively forced under published rails and gates, or if viable alternatives exist

## Critical Bug Discovery & Resolution

### **Previous Analysis Error**
The original P74 sweep (September 3, 2025) incorrectly concluded that **all 104 P74 combinations were mathematically infeasible**, including the published winner P[74]='T'. This was immediately flagged as impossible since `cand_005` shows `encrypts_to_ct:true` in audited results.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
Three critical bugs were identified in the lawfulness checker:

1. **Incorrect Beaufort Identity Rules**: Treating K=0 as illegal pass-through for Beaufort family
   - **Error**: Applied Vigenère/Variant-Beaufort rules to Beaufort
   - **Correct**: For Beaufort, K=0 gives C = -P (not identity), so K=0 is allowed
   - **Fix**: Family-specific illegal pass-through detection

2. **Incorrect Proof Parameters**: Using default parameters instead of actual `proof_digest.json` values
   - **Error**: Generic parameter assumptions instead of winner-specific configuration
   - **Correct**: Load actual families [vigenere, vigenere, beaufort, vigenere, beaufort, vigenere] and L=[17,16,16,16,16,16]
   - **Fix**: Direct `proof_digest.json` integration

3. **Anchor Position Logic**: Potential errors in pre-T₂ vs post-T₂ anchor checking
   - **Fix**: Verified anchors checked at pre-T₂ positions with proper encryption consistency

### **Validation**
Unit test confirms published winner P[74]='T' now shows:
```
✅ WINNER IS LAWFUL
   Encrypts to CT: True
   Forced residues: 24
   Full key size: 97
```

## Rails & Policy Summary (Unchanged)

**Rails Enforced**:
- **Anchors locked**: EAST (21-24), NORTHEAST (25-33), BERLINCLOCK (63-73) as plaintext at 0-indexed positions
- **Head lock**: [0, 74] (positions 0-74 inclusive)  
- **Tail guard**: null (seam-free analysis)
- **NA-only permutations**: Routes that fix anchor positions by exclusion from permutation domain
- **Option-A**: No illegal pass-through (K≠0 for Vig/VB), no residue collisions at anchors

**Model Class**:
- **Routes**: GRID_W14_ROWS (primary analysis)
- **Classings**: c6a multi-class schedules (6 interleaved keys)
- **Families**: Mixed [vigenere, vigenere, beaufort, vigenere, beaufort, vigenere] per winner proof
- **Periods**: [17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16] per winner proof
- **Phases**: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] per winner proof

## CORRECTED Analysis Results

### **Mathematical Feasibility Assessment**

**Critical Finding**: **All 26 P74 letters are mathematically lawful** under the corrected constraint system.

**Lawfulness Results**:
- **Route**: GRID_W14_ROWS / c6a
- **P74 Tested**: 26 letters (T, S, A, I, O, N, R, E, H, L, D, U, M, F, C, G, Y, P, W, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z)
- **Lawful**: 26/26 (100%)
- **Unlawful**: 0/26 (0%)
- **All candidates**: `encrypts_to_ct=true`, 24 forced anchor residues, 97 full key schedule entries

## Revised Interpretation & Implications

### **Primary Interpretation REVISION**

**Original Erroneous Conclusion**: P[74] was mathematically over-constrained to the point where even published solutions violated feasibility.

**CORRECTED Conclusion**: **P[74] is NOT mathematically forced by anchors + multi-class constraints alone**. All 26 letters satisfy the basic cryptographic requirements (anchor constraints, Option-A rules, encryption consistency).

### **Technical Insight**
The combination of:
1. **24 anchor positions** with fixed plaintext values
2. **Multi-class schedules** (c6a) with 6 interleaved keys  
3. **Mixed cipher families** ([vig, vig, beaufort, vig, beaufort, vig])
4. **Option-A requirements** (correct family-specific pass-through rules)
5. **NA-only permutations** that fix anchor positions

Creates a **mathematically well-determined system** where P[74] alternatives can satisfy the fundamental cipher constraints, contradicting the mathematical compulsion hypothesis.

### **Implications for "THEJOY" Analysis**

**The next analysis phase** must now test viable P74 alternatives against the **linguistic gates**:
1. **AND Gate**: Flint v2 + Generic phrase scoring on head [0,74]
2. **Nulls**: 10,000 mirrored draws with Holm m=2 correction (adj-p < 0.01)

**Research Question**: If multiple P74 letters are mathematically feasible, what distinguishes P[74]='T' during gate evaluation?

**Hypothesis**: The **linguistic constraint system** (not mathematical constraints) provides the effective forcing mechanism for "THEJOY" at positions 74-79.

## Next Steps Required

**Status**: Mathematical feasibility resolved. **Linguistic gate analysis pending**.

**Required Implementation**: 
1. **AND Gate Evaluation**: Apply Flint v2 + Generic phrase scoring to all 26 lawful P74 candidates
2. **Nulls Analysis**: Statistical significance testing against 10,000 mirrored draws
3. **Holm Correction**: Multiple testing correction with m=2, threshold adj-p < 0.01
4. **Final Verdict**: Determine which P74 alternatives (if any) achieve `publishable:true` status

**Expected Outcome**: P[74]='T' likely unique in passing both mathematical AND linguistic requirements, suggesting **linguistic compulsion** rather than mathematical compulsion for "THEJOY".

## Conclusion

**Definitive Mathematical Result**: **P[74] is NOT mathematically forced** under anchors + NA-only permutations + Option-A + multi-class schedules alone.

**Mechanism**: All 26 P[74] letters satisfy the cryptographic constraint system with identical structure (24 forced residues → 97 key schedule entries).

**THEJOY Status**: **Pending linguistic gate analysis** - mathematical feasibility confirmed for alternatives, linguistic forcing mechanism to be tested.

**Analysis Quality**: **High confidence** - corrected implementation validates against published winner and shows consistent mathematical behavior across all P74 candidates.
