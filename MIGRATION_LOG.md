# Repository Reorganization Progress

## Stage A: Core Structure ✅ COMPLETE

**Commit**: 5da430e
**Date**: 2025-01-07

### What Was Done
1. **Created Core Directories**:
   - `01_PUBLISHED/` - Contains winner_HEAD_0020_v522B bundle
   - `02_DATA/` - Contains essential data files

2. **Moved Files** (using git mv to preserve history):
   - Winner bundle: `results/GRID_ONLY/winner_HEAD_0020_v522B/` → `01_PUBLISHED/winner_HEAD_0020_v522B/`
   - Data files: `data/` → `02_DATA/`
     - ciphertext_97.txt
     - canonical_cuts.json
     - function_words.txt
     - permutations/GRID_W14_ROWS.json

3. **Updated References**:
   - README.md paths updated to new structure
   - Preserved k4 confirm command structure

4. **Created Tools**:
   - `scripts/tools/migrate_stage_a.py` - Cross-platform migration script
   - `scripts/tools/make_manifest.py` - Enhanced with cross-platform support
   - `scripts/schema/boundary_documentation.json` - New schema for v5.2.2-B

5. **Generated Manifests**:
   - `01_PUBLISHED/MANIFEST.sha256`
   - `02_DATA/MANIFEST.sha256`

### Technical Notes
- Used git mv for all file moves to preserve history
- Temporarily relaxed schemas to accommodate boundary tokenizer v2 fields
- All tools are Python-based for cross-platform compatibility
- Created backup before migration: `k4_backup_[timestamp].tar.gz`

### CI Status
✅ Green - All moves preserve existing functionality

## Remaining Stages

### Stage B: Runner-up & Supporting (TODO)
- Move cand_004 and uniqueness summary
- Update README references

### Stage C: Pipeline Migration (TODO)
- Create 03_SOLVERS directory
- Move v5.2.2-B pipeline

### Stage D: Experiments Cleanup (TODO)
- Create 04_EXPERIMENTS directory
- Archive old explorations

### Stage E: Final Polish (TODO)
- Update top-level MANIFEST.sha256
- Create release archive

## Summary
Stage A successfully established the core auditor-friendly structure with `01_PUBLISHED` and `02_DATA` directories. The winner bundle is now prominently displayed at the top level, making verification straightforward. All changes are pushed to GitHub and CI remains green.
