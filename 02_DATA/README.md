# K4 Data Files

## Files
- `ciphertext_97.txt` - The 97-character K4 ciphertext
- `control_points.json` - Control point indices for BERLINCLOCK verification
- `antipodes_layout.json` - Antipodes reordering configuration

## Indexing Policy
**All indices are zero-based throughout the codebase.**
- BERLIN: positions 63-68 (zero-based)
- CLOCK: positions 69-73 (zero-based)
- 1-indexed reference for documentation: 64-74

Note: Public K4 clues often use 1-based indexing. When referencing external sources, 1-based 64-74 equals 0-based 63-73.
