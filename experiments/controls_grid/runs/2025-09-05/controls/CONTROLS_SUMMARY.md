# GRID Controls Test

**Date**: 2025-09-05
**Seed**: 1337
**Purpose**: Verify control heads fail as expected

## Control Imperatives Tested

| Control | Imperative Start | Result | Failure Mode |
|---------|------------------|--------|--------------|
| IS_A_MAP | LAYERTWOISEAMAPWESTSOUTHE... | ✗ Failed | No valid GRID transposition found |
| IS_TRUE | LAYERTWOISSSTRUEWESTSOUTH... | ✗ Failed | Gibberish output from GRID |
| IS_FACT | LAYERTWOISSAFACTWESTSOUTH... | ✗ Failed | Does not encrypt to K4 ciphertext |

## Expected vs Actual

| Metric | Expected | Actual | ✓ |
|--------|----------|--------|---|
| Valid plaintexts | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| Encrypts to CT | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| Pass phrase gate | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| Publishable | 0 | 0 | ✓ |

## Key Findings

1. **All control heads failed as expected**
2. No control produced valid GRID transposition output
3. No control encrypted to the K4 ciphertext
4. Controls confirm GRID method is selective

## Interpretation

The control imperatives (IS A MAP, IS TRUE, IS FACT) were designed to test whether
arbitrary surveying-like text could produce valid solutions through the GRID method.
**All controls failed**, confirming that:

1. The GRID transposition has specific alignment requirements
2. Not all imperatives produce readable plaintext
3. The published solution is not a chance occurrence

## Conclusion

Control heads behaved as expected - none produced valid solutions.
This strengthens confidence in the selectivity of the GRID method.

**Report-only analysis; validates GRID method selectivity.**
