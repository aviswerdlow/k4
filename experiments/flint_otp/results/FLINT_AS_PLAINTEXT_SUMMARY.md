# FLINT AS PLAINTEXT - TEST RESULTS

## Configuration

- Plaintext: Constructed from Flint quotes with 74/97 known positions
- Running keys tested: K1, K2, K3 plaintexts
- Encoding methods: Vigen√®re (C = P + K) and Beaufort (C = K - P)

## Results

**No significant matches found.**

K1/K2/K3 as running keys cannot reproduce K4 ciphertext with Flint-based plaintext segments at the anchor positions.

## Conclusion

The secondary path (Flint as plaintext with K1/K2/K3 as running keys) does not produce the K4 ciphertext at the required anchor positions.
