# Pipeline v2 Final Sign-Off

**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Checkpoint Tag:** `explore-v2-aggressive-2025-01-06`  
**Branch:** `pipeline-v2-explore-aggressive`  
**CI Status:** GREEN ✅

## Executive Summary

We have transformed Explore into a true pressure chamber: broad hypothesis intake, hard falsification, clean analytics, and zero leakage into Confirm. The instrumentation is operational and trustworthy.

## What We've Locked In

### ✅ Instrumentation
- Windowed anchors are real and measurable (r=n captures ±n shifts)
- Blinding holds firm (no narrative leakage)
- Controls are hard (matched n-gram, near-anchor patterns)
- Orbits prevent false uniqueness
- TTL maintains hygiene (13 runs archived)

### ✅ Scale
- **3,000+ heads** tested across all campaigns
- **18 window policies** (r×typo_budget grid)
- **5 registers** + data-driven sampling
- Deterministic seeds throughout (1337)
- Manifests and hashes everywhere

### ✅ Outcome
- **0 promotions** — which is SUCCESS for Explore
- Current hypothesis families don't survive blinded, falsifiable deltas
- Confirm remains idle as designed

## Deliverables

### Dashboard & Aggregation
- **Dashboard CSV:** `experiments/pipeline_v2/runs/2025-01-06-explore-aggressive/DASHBOARD.csv`
- **Summary Report:** `experiments/pipeline_v2/runs/2025-01-06-explore-aggressive/DASHBOARD_SUMMARY.md`
- **Aggregate One-Liner:** "0 promotions across 3,000+ heads; Explore kills weak hypotheses; Confirm idle"

### Key Paths
- **Explore-Aggressive Overview:** `experiments/pipeline_v2/runs/2025-01-06-explore-aggressive/`
- **Instrument Status:** `experiments/pipeline_v2/docs/INSTRUMENT_STATUS.md`
- **Campaign Status:** `experiments/pipeline_v2/docs/EXPLORE_AGGRESSIVE_STATUS.md`

### README Update
Added single paragraph pointer:
> We executed five Explore-only campaigns (register expansion, data-driven sampling, window elasticity grid, harder controls, report-only alt signals). Blinded scoring + falsifiable anchors + hard controls yielded 0 promotions across thousands of heads. Confirm remains idle. Artifacts are reproducible, hash-pinned, and CI clean.

## Completed Actions

### ✅ Minimal Wrap-Up
1. **Checkpoint tag created:** `explore-v2-aggressive-2025-01-06`
2. **README updated:** Single pointer + concise paragraph
3. **TTL sweep complete:** 13 stale runs archived, TTL_LOG.md updated

### ✅ Optional Campaigns
- **K-style mimic:** 50 heads with K1-K3 cadence bias (report-only)
- **Alternative signals:** LZ/MI/entropy computed
- **Controls++:** Matched distributions validated

## When to Consider Confirm Burst

If — and only if — Explore emits a **single** head that:
- Beats both deltas (δ₁ > 0.05, δ₂ > 0.10)
- On ≥2 GRID variants
- Survives orbits and 1k nulls

Then queue a 3-5 candidate Confirm burst with:
- Pre-registration (no threshold changes)
- AND gate + 10k nulls
- Full mini-bundles

Until then, Confirm stays idle.

## Conclusion

**Explore v2 is officially "operational and trustworthy"**

The ladder is falsifiable and clean. We can either:
1. Continue probing new hypothesis families in Explore
2. Hold position and wait for outside submissions
3. Queue targeted Confirm bursts if/when survivors emerge

The two-lane discipline holds: Explore kills fast, Confirm awaits genuine signals.
