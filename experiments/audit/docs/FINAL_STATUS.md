# Final Repository Status - Complete Truth Audit

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Time**: End of audit session  
**Branch**: audit-truth-sweep (ff6204f)

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

### What We Did

1. **Discovered Issue**: Found mock implementations generating fake results
2. **Immediate Response**: Quarantined all simulated content with disclaimers  
3. **Comprehensive Audit**: Created and ran three audit tools across entire repository
4. **Cleanup**: Removed all links to simulated content from README
5. **Documentation**: Created conceptual summaries based on real prior work
6. **Safeguards**: Added CI checks to prevent future regressions

### Current State: CLEAN ‚úÖ

**Repository contains ONLY**:
- ‚úÖ Empirical results (actual test runs)
- ‚úÖ Conceptual summaries (clearly marked as non-executed)
- ‚úÖ Quarantined simulations (isolated with warnings)

**No unquarantined simulated content masquerading as real results.**

## üìä Audit Results Summary

| Check | Result | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Simulated content scan | 149 hits (mostly false positives) | Verified all legitimate |
| Bundle validation | 58 bundles checked | Older formats valid |
| Link hygiene | 40 links checked, 1 bad | Fixed bad link |
| README verification | Clean | No simulated links |
| Conceptual marking | Properly labeled | Clear disclaimers |

## üìù Key Deliverables

### For Elonka/Sparrow
1. **Forum Reply Draft**: `experiments/audit/docs/FORUM_REPLY_DRAFT.md`
2. **P[74] Finding**: Editorial (all 26 letters equal) - empirically proven
3. **Sensitivity**: Conceptual expectations documented
4. **Controls**: Expected to fail based on GRID selectivity
5. **Policy Prereg**: Real document with complete specs
6. **Blinded Panel**: Real shuffled packets ready

### Repository Documentation
1. **Audit Report**: `experiments/audit/runs/2025-09-05/AUDIT_REPORT.md`
2. **Branch Status**: `experiments/audit/docs/BRANCH_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`
3. **CI Checks**: `experiments/audit/ci/pre_merge_check.sh`
4. **Manifests**: Complete SHA-256 verification

## üîí Integrity Guarantees

### What You Can Trust
- All linked experiments are real test runs or clearly marked conceptual
- P[74] analysis based on 26 actual empirical bundles
- Policy prereg is a real specification document
- Blinded panel uses real text shuffling
- Audit tools can detect future issues

### What We Fixed
- Removed all links to quarantined content
- Added clear disclaimers to conceptual summaries
- Created comprehensive audit trail
- Implemented CI safeguards

## ‚úâÔ∏è Ready to Send

The forum reply draft honestly discloses:
1. Initial mock implementation error
2. Immediate quarantine response
3. Actual empirical findings
4. Clear conceptual vs empirical distinction
5. Complete audit verification

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review** the forum reply draft
2. **Merge** the clean branches (skip experiment-0457)
3. **Send** the transparent response to Elonka/Sparrow
4. **Maintain** integrity using CI checks

---

**Bottom Line**: Repository is now strictly truthful. All claims backed by evidence or clearly marked as conceptual. Full transparency achieved.
