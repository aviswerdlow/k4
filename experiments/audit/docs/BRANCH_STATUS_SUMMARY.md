## Active Branches

### 1. experiment-0457 
**Status**: Contains simulated outputs (frozen for historical record)
**SHA**: 16fc25e
**Content**: Original 04:57 packet implementation with mock scripts
**Action**: Do not merge - historical reference only

### 2. hotfix-0457-sim-quarantine

**SHA**: e51496f  
**Changes**: 
- Moved simulated content to `experiments/_simulated/0457/`
- Added disclaimers and hotfix notes
- Removed most README links to simulated content
**Action**: Can be merged after review

### 3. audit-truth-sweep (current)
**Status**: Comprehensive audit complete
**SHA**: 719338f
**Changes**:
- Created audit framework (SIM_DETECTOR, BUNDLE_VALIDATOR, LINK_HYGIENE)
- Removed final simulated link from README
- Added audit reports and manifests
- Verified repository integrity
**Action**: Ready to merge - repository is clean

## Repository State

### Verified Empirical Content
- `experiments/alternates/` - Surveying imperative testing
- `experiments/p74/` - Position 74 analysis
- `experiments/typo_tolerance/` - Misspelling sensitivity
- `experiments/anchors_only/` - Anchor constraints
- `experiments/anchors_multiclass/` - Multi-class anchor analysis
- `experiments/seam_free/` - Tail invariance
- `experiments/cadence_panel/` - Style comparison
- `experiments/internal_push/` - Boundary tokenization

### Conceptual Content (Clearly Marked)
- `experiments/0457_conceptual/` - Expected behaviors without execution

### Quarantined Content
- `experiments/_simulated/0457/` - Mock implementations with disclaimers

## Merge Strategy

Recommended merge order:
1. Merge `hotfix-0457-sim-quarantine` to main
2. Merge `audit-truth-sweep` to main
3. Archive `experiment-0457` branch (do not merge)

## Verification Commands

After merge, verify integrity:

```bash
# Check for simulated content outside quarantine
find experiments -type f -name "*.py" | xargs grep -l "simulated" | grep -v "_simulated"

# Verify no links to _simulated
grep -r "_simulated" README.md VALIDATION.md

# Check audit results
cat experiments/audit/runs/2025-09-05/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge clean branches
2. Archive historical branch with simulated content
3. Enable CI guards using audit scripts
4. Send cleaned reply to Elonka/Sparrow
