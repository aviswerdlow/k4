**Seed:** 1337  

## Executive Summary

- **Total Heads Generated:** 17
- **Total Promotions:** 0
- **Best Track:** None
- **Best δ_windowed:** 0.0000
- **Best δ_shuffled:** 0.0000

## Track Results

| Track | Heads | Promotions | Rate | Avg δ_w | Avg δ_s | Gen Quality |
|-------|-------|------------|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Track_A | 2 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0004 |
| Track_B | 10 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0010 |
| Track_C | 5 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.0000 | -0.0180 | 0.0001 |

## Key Findings

### Result: No Promotions

Despite the generation-first approach, no heads passed both delta thresholds.

This suggests the hypothesis space may be fundamentally incompatible with the requirements.


## Comparison to v2

- **v2 Issue:** Generated heads scored -5.88σ below random on n-grams
- **v3 Approach:** Direct optimization of language quality
- **v3 Result:** Still no promotions, but better language scores


## Recommendations

1. **Hypothesis space appears exhausted** - consider alternative approaches
2. **Delta thresholds may be too strict** for this problem domain
3. **Consider relaxing constraints** or exploring different cipher systems
