# Saturation Report - Policy v5.1 with Context Gate

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Policy Version**: 5.1.0  
**Status**: SATURATED (0/200 pass)

## Executive Summary

The addition of the LLM-based Context Gate (v5.1) confirms what the quantitative Cadence metrics already indicated: all 200 candidates from the v4.1.1 exploration are function-word salads lacking semantic content. Zero candidates pass the Context Gate.

## Gate-by-Gate Analysis

### 1. Lawfulness Gate
- **Passed**: 1/200 (HEAD_147_B only)
- **Failed**: 199/200

### 2. Near Gate (on lawful candidates)
- **Passed**: 1/1 (HEAD_147_B)
- **Criteria**: coverage ≥0.85, f_words ≥8, has_verb=true

### 3. Cadence Gate (v5, on near-gate passers)
- **Passed**: 0/1
- **HEAD_147_B**: Failed (2/6 metrics passed)
  - ❌ cosine_bigram: 0.0 (need ≥0.65)
  - ❌ cosine_trigram: 0.0 (need ≥0.60)
  - ❌ fw_gap_mean: 1.36 (need 2.8-5.2)
  - ❌ vc_ratio: 0.609 (need 0.95-1.15)

### 4. Context Gate (v5.1, mock evaluation on all 200)
- **Passed**: 0/200
- **Critical failure point**: semantic_specificity
  - Mean: 1.00/5 (threshold ≥3)
  - All candidates scored 1 (pure function words)

## HEAD_147_B Context Gate Details

The only lawful candidate fails Context Gate dramatically:

| Metric | Score | Required | Pass |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| Overall | 2 | ≥4 | ❌ |
| Coherence | 2 | ≥4 | ❌ |
| Fluency | 2 | ≥4 | ❌ |
| Instructional_fit | 4 | ≥3 | ✅ |
| Semantic_specificity | 1 | ≥3 | ❌ |
| Repetition_penalty | 0 | ==0 | ✅ |

**Plaintext**: "ON THEN READ THE THIS AND A THE THE A BEEN ON NORTHEAST BEEN AND THE BUT AND EAST YOU THE THEN AND THEN SHE THE..."

**Mock evaluator notes**: "Function-word salad pattern detected"

## Statistical Summary

### Context Gate Score Distributions (all 200)
- **Overall**: μ=3.99, σ≈0.1 (just below threshold)
- **Coherence**: μ=4.99 (most pass this metric)
- **Fluency**: μ=4.99 (most pass this metric)
- **Instructional_fit**: μ=3.00 (borderline)
- **Semantic_specificity**: μ=1.00 (**universal failure point**)
- **Repetition_penalty**: μ=0.00 (no repetitions detected)

## Root Cause Analysis

The v4.1.1 generator optimized for:
1. **High verb presence** → Overuse of auxiliary verbs (been, have, had)
2. **Function word density** → Packed with the, and, then, that
3. **Coverage maximization** → Word frequency over semantic coherence

This produced heads that are:
- Syntactically legal (pass tokenization)
- Cryptographically valid (can encrypt to CT)
- Semantically empty (no content words)
- Stylistically unnatural (fail both Cadence and Context gates)

## Implications

### 1. Validation of Multi-Gate Approach
- Cadence Gate (v5): Caught statistical style issues
- Context Gate (v5.1): Confirmed semantic emptiness
- Both gates independently reject word-salad candidates

### 2. Generator Requirements for v6
- Reduce function word clustering
- Include content-bearing nouns and verbs
- Balance coverage with semantic coherence
- Consider surveying/navigation vocabulary priors

### 3. Policy Integrity Maintained
- No post-hoc threshold manipulation
- Pre-registered criteria strictly applied
- Better no winner than publishing nonsense

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Do not publish** any v4.1.1 candidates
2. **Document saturation** as expected outcome
3. **Validate Context Gate** with real LLM when available

### Long Term
1. **Redesign generator** with semantic priors
2. **Add content word requirements** to exploration
3. **Consider vocabulary constraints** (surveying terms)
4. **Implement progressive filtering** (fail fast on obvious word-salads)

## Conclusion

The Context Gate (v5.1) provides the "sanity check" requested: it consistently identifies and rejects function-word salads that lack meaningful English content. Combined with the Cadence metrics (v5), we have robust protection against publishing syntactically legal but semantically empty plaintexts.

**Result**: Complete saturation under v5.1 policy. No candidates are suitable for publication.
