===========================================
Generated: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}
MASTER_SEED: 1337

OBJECTIVE
---------
Hunt for mechanisms that reduce the 50 unknown head positions under L=17
without importing extra plaintext or using semantic gates.

TESTS PERFORMED
---------------

C1 - K3 Connection (4×7 Structure)
-----------------------------------
• 4×7 transposition on unknowns: NO REDUCTION
  - Applied grid transposition to unknown positions only
  - Result: Still 50 unknowns (anchors/tail preserved)
  
• L=7 overlay on unknowns: NO REDUCTION
  - Used L=7 period for unknown positions while keeping L=17 for known
  - Result: Still 50 unknowns (conflicts prevented reduction)
  
• Hybrid 4×7 + L=7: NO REDUCTION
  - Combined approaches didn't improve results

C6 - CLOCK Arithmetic
--------------------
• Mod-12/60 driver: ARTIFICIAL CLOSURE
  - Filled unknown slots with clock-derived values
  - Not a genuine mechanism discovery (just arbitrary fill)
  
• Clock-face transposition: NO REDUCTION
  - Permuted unknowns based on clock positions
  - Result: Still 50 unknowns
  
• Anchor-gated switching: ARTIFICIAL CLOSURE
  - Used distance from CLOCK to fill unknowns
  - Again, arbitrary fill not genuine discovery

C4 - KRYPTOS Keyword (from initial run)
---------------------------------------
• Running-key overlay: NO REDUCTION
  - KRYPTOS keyword didn't reduce unknowns
  
• Keyworded transposition: NO REDUCTION
  - Using KRYPTOS for column sorting didn't help

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. NO GENUINE MECHANISM found that reduces unknowns below 50
2. L=17 creates a perfect 1-to-1 mapping preventing constraint propagation
3. Initial "successes" were due to:
   - Implementation bugs (Hill identity)
   - Artificial slot filling (not discovering actual constraints)
   - Constraint violations (L=7 broke anchors)

CLEAN NEGATIVE RESULTS
----------------------
All tested mechanisms failed to reduce unknowns while preserving:
• Anchor positions (EAST, NORTHEAST, BERLIN, CLOCK)
• Tail positions (74-96)
• Already-determined letters

This confirms the mathematical necessity:
- L=17 with 97 positions creates 97 unique (class, slot) pairs
- Each unknown position requires its own constraint
- No algebraic shortcut exists within panel-consistent mechanisms

VALIDATION
----------
✓ All tests used deterministic MASTER_SEED=1337
✓ No semantic gates or language models
✓ Anchors and tail preserved in valid tests
✓ Pure algebraic/mechanical analysis

CONCLUSION
----------
The 50 unknown positions under L=17 cannot be reduced through:
• Period changes (L=7, L=28)
• Transposition patterns (4×7 grid, clock-face)
• Keyword overlays (KRYPTOS)
• Clock arithmetic (mod-12/60)
• Boundary mechanisms

This is a mathematically robust negative result that helps define
the boundary of what's possible with current constraints.

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
To make progress, one of the following is needed:
1. Additional plaintext constraints (new anchors)
2. External key material (not panel-consistent)
3. Different fundamental mechanism (not polyalphabetic)
4. Acceptance that 50 positions remain indeterminate algebraically
