**Selected Stage‑1 Intermediate String (97 chars)**  
`QVIHUPXCMJKAVIAUVFCCXEASTNORTHEASTOHCVGHDGEBRKAAXZIKIISFKUUYNGBBERLINCLOCKXHEJOYOFANANGLEISTHEARC`

**Brief justification (per directive):**
- **Anchor & seam integrity:** Contains *EASTNORTHEAST* and *BERLINCLOCK* in their canonical slots and ends with the verified seam fragment **HEJOYOFANANGLEISTHEARC**.
- **Cryptographic consistency:** The pre‑seam bridge **HEJOY** is the literal output of the two‑pass backbone+gate model; no editorial edits applied.
- **Lexicon (tertiary):** We did *not* privilege incidental lexicon tokens over constraints; candidates in set B with appealing tokens were disqualified for violating the anchor/seam test.
