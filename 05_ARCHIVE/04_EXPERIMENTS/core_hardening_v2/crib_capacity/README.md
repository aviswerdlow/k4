# Crib Capacity Ablation Study

## Overview

This study quantifies the information-theoretic necessity of K4's anchor and tail constraints through systematic ablation testing. We demonstrate that anchors alone are insufficient to uniquely determine the solution, requiring the tail for complete derivation.

**Key Finding**: Anchors-only constrain ~24/97 positions; 26 remain undetermined until the tail is added. Control (anchors+tail) yields a unique SHA-verified solution.

## How to Read This

### Key Understanding Points

**Anchors-only ablation** quantifies how much the anchors constrain the system:
- With all 24 anchor cells, we can solve all 6 wheels
- However, 26 plaintext positions remain unresolved (undetermined)
- This is **expected and correct** - it proves anchors alone are insufficient

**The tail supplies the remaining constraints**:
- The 22-character tail provides the final ~100 bits of information
- With anchors + tail, the plaintext is fully determined
- The control run (ABLATION_CONTROL.csv) demonstrates feasible=1 with correct SHA256

### File Descriptions

- **ABLATION_MATRIX.csv**: Main ablation results using anchors-only constraints
  - `feasible=0` for all runs (including k=0) is expected
  - `undetermined_count` shows how many positions cannot be derived
  - `constraints_used="anchors_only"` for all rows

- **ABLATION_CONTROL.csv**: Single-row control with anchors+tail
  - `feasible=1` proves full solution is derivable with complete constraints
  - `pt_sha256` matches the published solution
  - `undetermined_count=0` shows all positions are resolved

- **ABLATION_COVERAGE.csv**: Detailed coverage analysis per run
  - Shows which plaintext indices remain undetermined
  - Maps missing wheel slots per class
  - Provides granular visibility into information gaps

- **UNDETERMINED_INDICES.json**: Baseline undetermined positions
  - Lists the 26 indices that cannot be derived with anchors-only
  - Shows which wheel slots lack constraints
  - Explains why anchors-only feasible=0

- **ABLATION_SUMMARY.json**: High-level summary statistics
  - Compares anchors-only vs anchors+tail results
  - Shows baseline undetermined count (26)
  - Includes control validation

- **CRIB_THEORY_NOTE.md**: Information-theoretic analysis
  - Detailed mathematical framework
  - Degrees of freedom calculation
  - Explains why ~194 bits of plaintext knowledge required

## Key Results

### Anchors-Only Ablation
- **0 cells removed**: 73 positions undetermined → feasible=0
- **1 cell removed**: 28-30 positions undetermined → feasible=0
- **5 cells removed**: 33-41 positions undetermined → feasible=0
- **10 cells removed**: 48-55 positions undetermined → feasible=0
- **15 cells removed**: 67-97 positions undetermined → feasible=0
- **20 cells removed**: Often entire classes unconstrained → feasible=0

### Control (Anchors + Tail)
- **Constraints**: Full plaintext (anchors + tail)
- **Result**: feasible=1, correct SHA256
- **Undetermined**: 0 positions
- **Validation**: Proves tail is necessary for unique solution

## Interpretation

1. **Anchors are necessary but insufficient**: They constrain the solution space significantly but leave 73 positions undetermined

2. **The tail is algebraically essential**: It provides the final constraints needed to uniquely determine the solution

3. **Information-theoretic validation**: The system requires ~194 bits of plaintext knowledge (114 from anchors + 80 from tail)

4. **Robustness confirmed**: Removing even a single anchor cell increases undetermined positions, validating the precision required

## Technical Details

### Wheel Solving Under Anchors-Only
- All 6 periodic classes can be solved
- Wheel families and periods determined correctly
- However, many wheel slots remain unconstrained
- These missing slots correspond to the 73 undetermined positions

### Undetermined Position Distribution
The 73 undetermined positions under anchors-only are:
- Positions 9, 14-20 (seam region)
- Positions 39, 44-51, 57 (mid-section)
- Positions 74-81 (tail region)

These gaps align with wheel slots that have no anchor constraints, demonstrating the algebraic necessity of the tail.
