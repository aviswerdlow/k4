ALGEBRA_CORE_BUNDLE - Paper-First K4 Analysis
==============================================

For Forum Posting - December 2025

CONTENTS:
---------
1. ALGEBRA_CORE.pdf (4 pages)
   - Page 1: What algebra determines (24/97 positions)
   - Page 2: Tail & P74 structure tests
   - Page 3: K1-K3 mechanical precedents  
   - Page 4: What forces uniqueness

2. ANCHOR_LEDGER.txt
   - Complete arithmetic for all 24 anchor positions
   - Shows C, P, K values with mod-26 calculations
   - Verifiable with pencil and paper

3. WHEEL_CARD_BEFORE.pdf
   - Visual representation of wheel state with anchors only
   - Shows 24 determined slots across 6 classes
   - Demonstrates exactly which slots are forced

KEY CLAIMS (Falsifiable):
-------------------------
• With L=17 and 4 anchors, exactly 24 of 97 positions are determined
• The remaining 73 positions cannot be derived algebraically
• Position 74 specifically remains unconstrained
• The entire tail region (74-96) has 26^23 possible configurations

METHODOLOGY:
-----------
• Pure algebra - no AI, no hypothesis scaffolding
• Co-prime property ensures each slot appears ≤1 time
• 4 anchors force 24 unique slots → 24 derived positions
• All arithmetic verifiable by hand

VERIFICATION:
------------
All claims can be verified using:
- The anchor ledger (check arithmetic)
- The wheel cards (count forced slots)
- Basic modular arithmetic
- No computer required for validation

This demonstrates the algebraic limits of K4 constraint propagation.
