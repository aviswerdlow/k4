## Interpretation

The survey shows that L=15 would reduce unknowns to just 21 positions, making the 23-position tail sufficient for complete determination. However, this would require changing the fundamental period of the cipher.

With L=17 (the current hypothesis), we need all 73 remaining positions because of the 1-to-1 mapping between positions and (class, slot) pairs.
