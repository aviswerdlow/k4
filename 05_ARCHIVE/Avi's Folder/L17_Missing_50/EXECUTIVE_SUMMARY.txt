L=17 MISSING CONSTRAINTS - DEFINITIVE ANALYSIS
===============================================

BOTTOM LINE
-----------
With L=17, anchors + tail determine exactly 47/97 positions.
The remaining 50 positions CANNOT be reduced algebraically.
This is mathematically proven, not a limitation of method.

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. EXACT COUNT: 50 positions remain unknown
   - Positions: 0-20, 34-62, 74 (see L17_missing_constraints.txt)
   - Distribution: All in head region (0-73)

2. MATHEMATICAL PROOF: Minimum = 50
   - L=17 creates 1-to-1 mapping (97 unique slots)
   - Each constraint covers exactly 1 position
   - No propagation possible
   - Empirically confirmed: 49 constraints → 96/97
                            50 constraints → 97/97 ✓

3. L=15 COMPARISON:
   - L=15: Needs only 21 additional (tail sufficient)
   - BUT: Produces WRONG plaintext ("IREGXUWJOKQGLICP")
   - L=17: Needs 50 additional but produces CORRECT plaintext

WHAT THIS MEANS
---------------
Under L=17 with current constraints:
• We have a valid PARTIAL solution (47/97 correct)
• Need exactly 50 more constraints for completion
• No algebraic shortcut exists
• No hidden pattern found
• 1-to-1 mapping dominates completely

OPTIONS FORWARD
---------------
1. Submit as partial algebraic solution (47 known, 50 proven unknown)
2. Find additional anchor(s) in historical record
3. Accept that full determination requires semantic constraints
4. Consider L=15 despite wrong plaintext (algebraically complete)
