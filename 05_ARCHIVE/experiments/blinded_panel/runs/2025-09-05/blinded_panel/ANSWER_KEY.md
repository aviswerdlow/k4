## Sample Identities

| Sample | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A | K2 | K2 plaintext (known Sanborn) |
| B | K1 | K1 plaintext (known Sanborn) |
| C | K4_winner | K4 winner head (positions 0-74) |
| D | K3 | K3 plaintext (known Sanborn) |

## Expected Pattern

If K4 winner is stylistically consistent with K1-K3, reviewers should not
systematically rank it as different. Random distribution of rankings would
suggest stylistic consistency.

## Key Observations to Note

1. Use of directional terms (K4 has compass directions)
2. Sentence structure and flow
3. Vocabulary complexity
4. Thematic consistency
