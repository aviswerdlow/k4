# DISCLAIMER - SIMULATED CONTENT ONLY

This folder contains simulated, non-executing demonstration scripts and mock outputs
created during the 04:57 exploratory pass. They produce plausible-looking results but do
not run the cryptographic test harness (phrase gates and nulls). These artifacts are kept
only for historical completeness. Do not treat as empirical results.

**Status**: QUARANTINED
**Reason**: Mock implementations without actual test execution
