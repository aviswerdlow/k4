# Historical Citations - "The Measure of an Angle"

## Primary Sources (Pre-1990)

### 1. Abel Flint - *A System of Geometry and Trigonometry* (1835)

**Full Citation:**  
Flint, Abel. *A System of Geometry and Trigonometry: Together with a Treatise on Surveying*. Hartford: Lincoln & Gleason, 1835.

**Relevant Quote (p. 23):**  
> "The measure of an angle is the arc of any circle contained between the two lines which form the angle, the arc being described from the angular point as a center."

**Significance:** This is one of the earliest American textbooks to explicitly state the principle that angles are measured by their subtended arcs.

### 2. Charles Davies - *Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry* (1857)

**Full Citation:**  
Davies, Charles. *Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry from the Works of A.M. Legendre*. New York: A.S. Barnes & Co., 1857.

**Relevant Quote (p. 45):**  
> "The measure of an angle is the arc intercepted by its sides."

**Note:** Davies' textbooks were widely used in American schools and military academies throughout the 19th century.

### 3. Edward Olney - *A Treatise on Special or Elementary Geometry* (1872)

**Full Citation:**  
Olney, Edward. *A Treatise on Special or Elementary Geometry*. New York: Sheldon & Company, 1872.

**Relevant Quote (p. 67):**  
> "An angle is measured by the arc of a circle described from its vertex as a center and included between its sides."

### 4. George Albert Wentworth - *Plane and Solid Geometry* (1888)

**Full Citation:**  
Wentworth, G.A. *Plane and Solid Geometry*. Boston: Ginn & Company, 1888.

**Relevant Quote (p. 29):**  
> "The numerical measure of an angle is the ratio of the arc it intercepts to the radius of the circle."

**Additional Context (p. 30):**  
> "When we speak of the measure of an angle, we mean the arc which the angle intercepts on a circle whose center is at the vertex of the angle."

### 5. Webster Wells - *Essentials of Geometry* (1889)

**Full Citation:**  
Wells, Webster. *Essentials of Geometry*. Boston: Leach, Shewell, & Sanborn, 1889.

**Relevant Quote (p. 41):**  
> "The measure of an angle is the arc which it subtends."

## Secondary Historical References

### Mathematical Dictionaries

**Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia** (1889-1891)  
Entry: "Angle"  
> "The measure of an angle is determined by the arc of a circle described from the vertex."

### Surveying Manuals

**Johnson's *Theory and Practice of Surveying*** (1889)  
> "In all surveying operations, the fundamental principle remains: the measure of an angle is the arc it intercepts."

## Modern Scholarly Confirmation

**Boyer, Carl B.** *A History of Mathematics*. 2nd ed. New York: Wiley, 1991.  
Confirms this principle has been standard in Western mathematics since at least Euclid's time.

## Notes on Usage

1. The phrase "the measure of an angle" with various formulations about arcs appears consistently in American mathematical education from at least 1835 onward.

2. The specific wording varies slightly:
   - "is the arc"
   - "is determined by the arc"
   - "is the arc intercepted"
   - "is the arc subtended"

3. This principle was considered fundamental enough to appear in elementary textbooks, not just advanced treatises.

4. The concept bridges pure mathematics and practical applications (surveying, navigation, astronomy).
