# Historical Attestation Pack

## Overview

This collection documents the historical usage of the phrase "the measure of an angle" and its variants in mathematical literature predating 1990. This establishes that the geometric principle found in the K4 plaintext tail was well-established in educational texts long before Kryptos was created.

## Contents

### CITATIONS.md
Primary source citations from mathematical textbooks (1835-1889) that explicitly state the principle that an angle's measure is determined by its subtended arc.

### Key Sources
1. **Abel Flint (1835)** - Early American geometry textbook
2. **Charles Davies (1857)** - Widely used in US military academies
3. **Edward Olney (1872)** - Standard school geometry text
4. **George Wentworth (1888)** - Influential geometry textbook author
5. **Webster Wells (1889)** - Popular mathematics educator

## Significance for K4

The K4 plaintext tail "OFANOISECONSUMEENGLAND" can be interpreted as "OF AN θ IS E CONSUME ENGLAND" where:
- θ (theta) represents "angle"
- "IS E" could mean "is the arc E"
- This gives: "OF AN ANGLE IS THE ARC CONSUME ENGLAND"

This interpretation aligns with the standard geometric principle documented in these historical sources.

## Verification

All cited texts are available through:
- Google Books (digitized versions)
- Internet Archive (archive.org)
- HathiTrust Digital Library
- University library special collections

## Usage

Researchers can use these citations to:
1. Verify the pre-1990 existence of this mathematical phrasing
2. Understand the educational context Sanborn might have encountered
3. Support interpretations of the K4 tail as containing geometric content

## Additional Research

Future additions could include:
- European mathematical texts using similar phrasing
- Surveying manuals with practical applications
- Navigation texts referencing angle measurement
- Astronomy texts using arc measurement
