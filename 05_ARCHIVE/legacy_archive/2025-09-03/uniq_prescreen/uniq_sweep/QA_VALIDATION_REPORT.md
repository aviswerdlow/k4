# QA Validation Report - Faraday AND Search Implementation

**Generated**: $(date)

  - Anchors: EAST (21-24), NORTHEAST (25-33), BERLINCLOCK (63-73)
  - Head lock: P[74] = 'T'
  - Tail guard: "OFANANGLEISTHEARC" at position 80
- [x] **Generic thresholds** applied correctly
  - **Top 1%** perplexity threshold

### Failure Analysis
**Primary failure mode**: **POS threshold too high**
- All candidates with valid POS scores achieved ~0.6
- AND gate requires POS ‚â• 1.0 (original) or ‚â• 0.9-0.95 (escalation)
- Even most permissive tier (‚â• 0.9) still exceeded candidate capabilities

**Secondary considerations**:
- Perplexity scores varied (0.10 - 1.25), several would pass even 1% threshold
- Content word counts adequate (11-12 ‚â• 6 required)
- Max repeat acceptable (2 ‚â§ 2 required)

## üìÅ File Generation Validation

### Core Output Files ‚úÖ
- `GENERIC_SCREEN_RESULTS.json` - ‚úÖ Complete screening table
- `uniqueness_confirm_summary.json` - ‚úÖ Final verdict with AND policy
- `MANIFEST.sha256` - ‚úÖ File integrity manifest

### File Format Compliance ‚úÖ
- [x] `phrase_gate_policy.json` shows `combine:"AND"`, `tokenization_v2:true`
- [x] Generic thresholds documented correctly
- [x] Calibration file hashes included
- [x] Model class stanza matches specification
- [x] SHA-256 hashes generated for all files

## üîê Cryptographic Validation

### Rails Constraints ‚úÖ
All 10 candidates passed rails validation:
- [x] Length = 97 characters
- [x] All uppercase letters
- [x] EAST anchor at positions 21-24
- [x] NORTHEAST anchor at positions 25-33
- [x] BERLINCLOCK anchor at positions 63-73
- [x] P[74] = 'T' (head lock)
- [x] Tail guard "OFANANGLEISTHEARC" at position 80

### Proof Digest Validation (Ready) ‚úÖ
- [x] `encrypts_to_ct:true` assertion ready for Phase 2
- [x] `t2_sha256` pinning ready for Phase 2
- [x] Route ID tracking: "SPOKE_NE_NF_w1"

## üéØ Verdict Validation

### Final Uniqueness Determination ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "unique": false,
  "reason": "no_AND_passers"
}
```

**Interpretation**: Under the stricter AND policy, there are **no publishable candidates**. Uniqueness is **not established** because there's nothing to publish under the current AND thresholds, rather than being "non-unique."

### Policy Documentation ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "combine": "AND",
  "tokenization_v2": true,
  "generic": {
    "percentile_top": 1,
    "pos_threshold": 1.0,
    "min_content_words": 6,
    "max_repeat": 2
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Observations

1. **Threshold Calibration**: The AND policy successfully demonstrates increased rigor - no candidates pass where previous OR policy allowed passers.

2. **POS Scoring Reality Check**: POS scores of ~0.6 for English-like text appear realistic. The 1.0 threshold represents very high grammatical well-formedness requirements.

3. **Escalation Strategy Effectiveness**: All 4 escalation tiers failed, confirming that even relaxed thresholds (0.9) are too stringent for current candidates.

4. **Phrase Gate AND Logic**: Correctly implemented - requires BOTH Flint v2 AND Generic to pass.

## üîç QA Checklist Against Requirements

### User Requirements Compliance ‚úÖ
- [x] Two-phase screening implemented (Generic ‚Üí AND + nulls)
- [x] Tokenization v2 with head-only focus (0..74)
- [x] Real calibration scoring (not placeholders)
- [x] Escalation plan with 4 tiers
- [x] Verdict determination rules followed
- [x] Complete file generation per specification
- [x] MANIFEST.sha256 for verification

### Technical Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] `encrypts_to_ct:true` assertion framework ready
- [x] Holm correction (m=2) implemented for nulls
- [x] Proper error handling and logging
- [x] Consistent SHA-256 hashing throughout
- [x] File format compatibility with existing pipeline

### Output Completeness ‚úÖ
- [x] `GENERIC_SCREEN_RESULTS.json` with detailed table
- [x] `uniqueness_confirm_summary.json` with policy documentation
- [x] `MANIFEST.sha256` with integrity hashes
- [x] No candidate-specific directories (appropriate for 0 passers)

## üìã Final Assessment

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE AND COMPLIANT**

The implementation successfully demonstrates that under the tightened AND gate policy:
- **Phrase gate**: Flint v2 **AND** Generic (not OR)
- **Generic thresholds**: Top 1% perplexity + POS ‚â• 1.0
- **Result**: 0 AND passers across all escalation tiers

This outcome matches the user's expectation of "0 AND passers" and provides a clean, disciplined framework for future candidate evaluation should new candidates be discovered or thresholds be reconsidered.

**Recommendation**: The pipeline is ready for operational use. The "no AND passers" result should be reported as "uniqueness not established under AND policy" rather than "non-unique."
