- Std deviation: 0.0051
- Anchors preserved: 95/96

### 2 Glue Tokens

**0 promotions** - No heads exceed both δ₁ (0.05) and δ₂ (0.10) thresholds

## Language Score Components

Mean changes with 1 glue token:
- N-gram z-score: +0.235
- Coverage z-score: +0.255

## Conclusion

1. **Negligible impact** on combined scores
2. **Anchor alignment preserved** (corridor stays intact)
3. **No promotions** - improvements insufficient to beat thresholds
4. **Coverage benefit minimal** under blinding
