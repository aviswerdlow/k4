# Retraction Notice

## HEAD_147_B Retracted Under Policy v5

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Reason**: Failed mandatory cadence (style) gate

### Background
HEAD_147_B was provisionally published under policy v4 where cadence metrics were report-only. The plaintext exhibited severe stylistic deficiencies:
- Function-word salad structure
- Cosine similarity ~0.4 (threshold ≥0.65)
- Word-length χ² = 145.2 (threshold ≤95)
- Unnatural repetition patterns

### Policy Change (v4 → v5)
Cadence promoted from report-only to mandatory hard gate. Publication now requires:
- AND(Flint v2, Generic, **Cadence**)
