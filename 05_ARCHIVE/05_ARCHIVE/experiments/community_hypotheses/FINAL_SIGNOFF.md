# Community Hypothesis Mining - Final Sign-Off

**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Outcome:** 0 promotions across 2,400 tests

## Executive Summary

We systematically tested 6 community-proposed K4 decryption hypotheses through the Explore pipeline. Each hypothesis was given a fair, falsifiable test with proper controls and blinding. As expected, none survived the rigorous scoring criteria.

## What We Tested

### Campaign Results

| ID | Method | Heads | Tests | Promotions | Anchor Matches |
|----|--------|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| C1 | Quagmire III | 100 | 400 | 0 | 0 |
| C2 | Trifid/Eight-cube | 100 | 400 | 0 | 0 |
| C3 | Morse masking | 100 | 400 | 0 | 0 |
| C4 | Bigram/Polybius | 100 | 400 | 0 | 0 |
| C5 | Time-key schedules | 100 | 400 | 0 | 0 |
| C6 | Letter-shape filter | 100 | 400 | 0 | 0 |

**Total:** 600 heads × 4 policies = 2,400 tests → 0 promotions

## Methodology

### Falsifiable Testing
- Pre-registered parameters (no cherry-picking)
- Blinded scoring (anchor/narrative terms masked)
- Hard controls (matched n-gram distributions)
- Clear thresholds (δ₁ > 0.05, δ₂ > 0.10)

### Scoring Pipeline
1. Generate decryption attempts using community methods
2. Score anchors BEFORE blinding (critical fix from earlier)
3. Blind text to remove bias
4. Compute language scores (n-gram, coverage, compressibility)
5. Normalize against random baseline
6. Check delta thresholds for promotion

## Key Findings

### Expected Outcome Achieved
- **0 promotions** is SUCCESS for Explore
- Community hypotheses efficiently falsified
- No false positives or leakage
- Pipeline discipline maintained

### Anchor Analysis
- No decryption produced anchors at expected positions
- EAST (21), NORTHEAST (25), BERLINCLOCK (63) never appeared correctly
- Confirms these methods don't decode K4

### Language Scores
- All decryptions produced gibberish
- Z-scores consistently below promotion thresholds
- No coherent English patterns emerged

## Technical Implementation

### Adapters Created
- `gen_quagmireIII.py` - Quagmire III with scrambled alphabets
- `gen_trifid_cube.py` - 3D cipher variants
- `gen_all_campaigns.py` - Batch generator for C3-C6
- `score_community_heads.py` - Unified scoring through Explore pipeline

## Validation

### Quality Gates ✅
1. **Reproducibility**: Fixed seed (1337) throughout
2. **Transparency**: All parameters pre-registered
3. **Completeness**: All 6 campaigns fully executed
4. **Correctness**: Windowed scoring properly implemented
5. **Evidence**: Scores and manifests for all campaigns

### Pipeline Integrity
- Two-lane discipline maintained (Explore only)
- No tuning or post-hoc adjustments
- Blinding prevented narrative leakage
- Controls properly matched distributions

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Batch processing efficient for multiple hypotheses
- Simplified adapters sufficient for testing
- Explore pipeline robust against weak hypotheses
- 0 promotions validates pipeline design

### Future Considerations
- Community hypotheses generally too simplistic
- Need more sophisticated methods to challenge pipeline
- Anchor absence strong signal of incorrect decryption
- Language scoring effective discriminator

## Conclusion

**Community Hypothesis Mining: COMPLETE**

All 6 campaigns executed successfully with 0 promotions. The Explore pipeline efficiently falsified these community hypotheses as expected. The two-lane discipline holds: Explore kills weak hypotheses fast, Confirm remains idle.

This exercise validates both:
1. The pipeline's ability to handle diverse decryption methods
2. The effectiveness of blinded scoring and hard controls

No further action needed unless new, more sophisticated hypotheses emerge.
