The credibility hinges on ONE critical question:

    Are Sanborn's anchors PLAINTEXT or CLUES?

IF ANCHORS ARE PLAINTEXT:
  → Repository solution is almost certainly correct
  → Preserves all known constraints
  → Complete, meaningful English text
  → MIR HEAT is a remarkable statistical anomaly

IF ANCHORS ARE CLUES/KEYS:
  → MIR HEAT finding could be correct
  → ABSCISSA is the true key
  → 93% of K4 remains unsolved
  → Repository misinterpreted the anchors

EVIDENCE NEEDED:
1. Sanborn's exact words about the anchors
2. Context of his "masking technique" statement
3. Whether he confirmed anchors are plaintext
4. Any hints about ABSCISSA or geometric keys

RECOMMENDATION:
Without Sanborn's original statements, the repository solution 
appears more complete and internally consistent. However, the
MIR HEAT finding is too statistically significant to dismiss.

Both solutions should be investigated further.

    print("""
1. FIND SANBORN'S ORIGINAL STATEMENTS
   - Search for interviews, forum posts, emails
   - Contact Kryptos community for sources
   - Verify exact wording about anchors

2. TEST HYBRID APPROACHES
   - What if both solutions are partially correct?
   - Could K4 have multiple valid decryptions?
   - Is there a meta-layer we're missing?

3. EXPLORE ABSCISSA CONNECTION
   - Why does this specific word work?
   - Connection to coordinate geometry?
   - Link to "joy of an angle is the arc"?

4. VALIDATE REPOSITORY'S ALGEBRA
   - Independently verify their wheel derivation
   - Check if other solutions preserve anchors
   - Test for alternative 6-track configurations

5. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
   - Calculate exact probability of repository solution
   - Test more keys for MIR-like patterns
   - Analyze letter frequency distributions
