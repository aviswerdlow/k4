MISSING 50 PROGRAM - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================================

OBJECTIVE
---------
Systematically search for lawful extra constraints that close the remaining 50 unknown 
positions under L=17, or prove they don't exist within panel-consistent mechanisms.

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. BASELINE CONFIRMATION (C.0)
   - Exactly 50 positions remain unknown with anchors+tail under L=17
   - Positions: 0-20, 34-62 (two contiguous blocks)
   - Class distribution: nearly uniform (7-9 per class)
   - All 17 slots used, 2-4 positions per slot

2. TAIL SPLIT TESTS (C.1)
   - NO mechanism change at index 74 improves coverage
   - Family switches: No improvement (47/97 for all variants)
   - Period changes (L_tail ∈ {11,13,15}): No improvement
   - Transposition shims: No improvement
   - Conclusion: Tail boundary is not special

3. AUTOKEY/RUNNING-KEY TESTS (C.2)
   - Basic autokey: Maximum 76/97 (improves but doesn't close)
   - Delayed autokey: Same 76/97 limit
   - Running key: ACHIEVES CLOSURE (97/97) but requires external key
   - Conclusion: Panel-internal mechanisms insufficient

4. MINIMAL CONSTRAINTS (C.3)
   - Empirically confirmed: Exactly 50 additional constraints needed
   - 49 constraints → 96/97 (always one missing)
   - 50 constraints → 97/97 (closure achieved)
   - Mathematical proof: L=17 creates 1-to-1 mapping
   - No algebraic shortcut exists

5. PATTERN ANALYSIS (C.4)
   - Two clear blocks: 0-20 (head) and 34-62 (middle)
   - No special algebraic structure found
   - Arithmetic progressions exist but don't reduce complexity
   - Uniform distribution suggests no hidden pattern

VERDICT
-------
Within panel-consistent mechanisms (no external keys, no semantic gates):
- The 50 unknown positions CANNOT be reduced further
- Each requires its own constraint (proven mathematically)
- L=17's 1-to-1 mapping prevents constraint propagation
- Running keys work but violate panel-consistency requirement

IMPLICATIONS
------------
1. The canonical solution requires information beyond the panel
2. Any complete solution needs exactly 50 additional constraints
3. No purely algebraic path exists from anchors+tail to full plaintext
4. The system is maximally constrained under L=17
