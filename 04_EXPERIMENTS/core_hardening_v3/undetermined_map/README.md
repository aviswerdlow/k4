# Undetermined Positions Map

## Overview

This visualization shows which positions in the K4 plaintext are determined by anchors alone (via wheel propagation) versus which remain undetermined (red) without the tail.

## Key Findings

- **Total positions**: 97
- **Anchor constraints**: 24 positions (direct anchors)
- **Wheel-determined**: 71 positions (via propagation)
- **Undetermined**: 26 positions (need tail)
- **Tail region (75-96)**: 22 undetermined positions

## Visualization

The UND_MAP.svg shows:
- X-axis: Position indices (0-96)
- Y-axis: Classes (0-5) based on baseline skeleton formula
- Green circles: Positions determined by anchors (via wheel propagation)
- Red circles: Undetermined positions requiring tail
- Light blue background: Tail region (positions 75-96)

## Key Insight

The four anchors constrain the wheels sufficiently to determine 71 of 97 positions through algebraic propagation. However, 26 positions remain undetermined, confirming the algebraic necessity of the tail for unique solution determination. The tail region (75-96) contains 22 of these 26 undetermined positions.
