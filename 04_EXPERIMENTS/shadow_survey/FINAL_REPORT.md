# Fork H-Shadow - Shadow-Survey Modified Cipher Report

Generated: 2025-09-11 09:41:51

## Summary

- Total tests: 201
- Anchors preserved: 0
- Critical datetimes tested: 4
- Mask types: 3 (A-zones, B-zones, C-zones)
- Configurations: 3 (S-Light, S-Swap, S-Tri)
- Master seed: 1337

## NO MATCHES

No shadow-modified configuration preserved the anchors.

This suggests that:
1. Shadow geometry alone doesn't determine the cipher modification
2. Different zone mapping or parameter modifications are needed
3. The physical gating hypothesis may not apply to K4
